## Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction  


##### Introduction  

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide health issue. It is a type of kidney disease in which there is gradual loss of kidney function over a period of months to years. Kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and waste can build up in the body. Symptoms of CKD may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. CKD is usually detected on routine screening blood work by either an increase in serum creatinine, or protein in the urine.

##### The problem definition  

The capability to diagnose progressive CKD at an early stage and predict which patients are prone to progress is critical for timely therapeutic interventions. Therefore, the python program with the use of ANN predicts and classifies patients as having CKD or not.
