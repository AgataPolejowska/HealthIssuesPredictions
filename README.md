# Health Issues Predictions

## Diabetes Prediction


#### Introduction 


The Pima are a group of Native Americans living in Arizona. They have been the subject of intensive
study of diabetes as they have the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the world. 
The genetic predisposition, the introduction of non-native diet and the decline in physical activity 
is said to have been the leading contributing factor in the high rate of diabetes.

#### The problem definition

A machine learning model, which identifies people suffering from type 2 diabetes, needs to be developed.
Given this type of dataset the problem can be solved through binary classification, a type of supervised
learning where two categories are present, the person either has diabetes or has not.

## Pneumonia Prediction

#### Introduction

Pneumonia is a disease which is estimated as the leading cause of childhood mortality. According to 
the World Health Organization pneumonia kills about 2 million children under 5 years old every year.
Pneumonia can be caused by bacterial and viral pathogens. Bacterial penumonia requires antibiotic 
treatment, whereas viral pneumonia is treated with supportive care. As a result, accurate diagnostic 
process which identifies a particular abnormality is imperative.


#### The problem definition

The deep learning model has to be able to distinguish viral and bacterial pneumonia based on
a dataset of chest X-ray images that provide a two-dimensional images of a three-dimensional space.
Therefore, for this task the VGG16 convolutional neural network will be used for image classification
with weights pre-trained on ImageNet.

## Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction  


##### Introduction  

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide health issue. It is a type of kidney disease in which there is gradual loss of kidney function over a period of months to years. Kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and waste can build up in the body. Symptoms of CKD may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. CKD is usually detected on routine screening blood work by either an increase in serum creatinine, or protein in the urine.

##### The problem definition  

The capability to diagnose progressive CKD at an early stage and predict which patients are prone to progress is critical for timely therapeutic interventions. Therefore, the python program with the use of ANN predicts and classifies patients as having CKD or not.

## BreastCancerPrediction

#### Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer occuring in women, that causes the greatest number of cancer-related deaths. It is a significant public health problem in todayâ€™s society. The early diagnosis of breast cancer can improve the chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. In order to improve breast cancer outcomes and survival, early detection is critical.

#### The problem definition

Breast cancer is usually classified primarily by its histological appearance.  
Developing a machine learning python program, that automatically analyzes breast histology data for cancer risk factors,  
is essential.

## Heart Disease Prediction


#### Introduction
	
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. The causes, prevention and treatment of all
forms of cardiovascualr disease remain active fields of biomedical research. There are many risk factors for 
heart diseases: age, sex, diet, genetic predisposition, hypertension, raised blood sugar, hyperlipidemia etc.

#### The problem definition

Random Forest Classifier, a machine learning algorithm, will be used to predict potential heart disease in people.
Information obtained from the model can provide essential insights to doctors who can estabilsh proper treatment.
